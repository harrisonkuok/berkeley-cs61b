# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer: The use of helper functions is very useful and this would simplify the implemention and making the alorithm in different modules make the program easier to modify.

-----

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer: Each hexagon in project 3 can be seen as either a room or a hallway and we are randomly generating hallways and room and join them together.

-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: Drawing a hallway and drawing a room.

-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: A hallway would only have witdth of length that is 1 while a room has with and length that is larger than 1.
